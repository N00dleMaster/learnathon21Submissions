# Learnathon21Submissions
My Submissions for Kurius' Learnathon 21!

### mysql-react-qoom
The original plan for this was a todolist app that uses React, MySQL, and Qoom for authentication. Unfortunately, I did not have time enough for the MySQL and Qoom part.
If you'll excuse the misleading name, this app is a todoList made using React. It was submitted for the [React](hackitforward.com/challenge/25/) challenge.

### leetcode-challenges
These are a series of leetcode challenges for the [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://hackitforward.com/challenge/28/) challenge.
